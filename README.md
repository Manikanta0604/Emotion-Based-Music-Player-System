# Emotion-Based-Music-Player-System
Introduction: Music is one of the widely accepted cultures and languages which can be accepted by any type of people. Music does fill the silence and can hide the noise. It is an excellent way for a person to relieve stress. Choice of music of a person is dependent on the person’s mood. Mood ofa person can be inferred from the person’s emotion and emotions can be inferred from theperson's facial expressions. According to the survey, two-thirds of people's communication iscarried through non-verbal communication and facial expression constitutes the largestcomponent in this percentage.This project will embark on a groundbreaking journey to develop an “Emotion Based Music Player” that will accurately detect the emotion of a user and play the music accordingly. Nowadays, emotion detection is considered intrinsic in many applications such as retail, education, medical diagnosis, video gaming, security, criminal etc.
